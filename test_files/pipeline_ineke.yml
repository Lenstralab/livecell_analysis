### Parameters for pipeline_livecell_track_movies_yeast.py script

#########################################################################################################
#########################################################################################################


folderIn: "demo_data/" ### put path of input folder raw data, or your ims image
expList: ["20200128"]
outputfolder: "demo_output"

MaxProj: 1             ### note: If manually made with FIJI, order or channels may be different and the number of timeframes may not be read correctly in python
CellMask: 1            ### note: Makes cell mask. For 2 color data, uses green (2nd) channel
RunLocalize: 1         ### note: To find the localization spots (needs max.tif and sum_cells_mask.tif or TSregfiles(see below) either by functions above or by manual selection of ROIs)
WriteFiles: 1          ### note: Writes files (metadatahead, list.py and pdfs of tracks)
WriteMovies: 1         ### note: Creates a movie of the found spots
ComputeCorrelFunc: 1   ### note: Performs auto and cross correlation. For better results use pipeline_livecell_correlationfunctions

ChannelsToAnalyze: [0,1]  ### note: Provide list of channels to analyze: For 1-color data, use [0] regardless what color is used for imaging. For dual color imaging, use [0,1] where 0 is red channel and 1 is green channel.
swapColors: 1          ### note: the script assumes channel 1 is red and channel 2 is green. If this is reversed, set swapColors to 1.
fillIn: 1              ### note: fills in/determines intensity of spot at TS location in other channel.
fillInColors: "red"

#### fillInColors: Which color to fill in, only used if fillIn: 1
####            -"red": tracks green channel and uses green TS location to determine intensity in red channel.
####            -"green": tracks red channel and uses red TS location to determine intensity in green channel


##### PARAMETERS ######

sideViews: 1   # whether you want sideViews for the movie
zSlices: 9     # nr z slices
frames: 12 #240    # nr timeframes
microscope: "AxioObserver" # choose "spinningDisk" or "AxioObserver"
timeInterval: 10 ### time inteval between frame in seconds. Only used for spinningDisk



#### Localize parameters ####

# The script finds spots in 2 steps with high and low thesholds. First it will find the most intense spots using the "thresholdSD" threshold. Second, it will find spots with a lower threshold ("thresholdSD"-"diffThresholdSD") in the vicinity of high intensity spots (with distance threshold "dist"). Lastly, it will fill in frames that don't have spot about both thresholds by using the xy location of the first burst or the previous burst.

thresholdSD_Red: 5 # Threshold in number of standard deviations for high threshold. Fill in this one for 1 color analysis
thresholdSD_Green: 6 # Threshold in number of standard deviations for high threshold
diffThresholdSD: 2 # difference high - low threshold
writeLocTifFiles: 1 # set to 1 if you want to write movies of all the spots found for the low and high threshold. It may crash if you have many timeframes.

psfPx: 2 # PSF width in pixels
maxDist: 3 # Maximal distance tolerated between guess and fit (in PSF width)
minSeparation: 0.1 # Minimal distance tolerated between two spots (in PSF width)
dist: 10 # maximal distance tolerated between previous spot (from higher threshold) and spot found with lower threshold
winSize: 5 # window size in pixels used for fitting PSF

#It is possible to prelocate TS with FIJI (macro_tracking.ijm), to make it easier to find the the TS. The script will then only search in the radius of the spots. List name of regfile below:
TSregfile: [] ##['2019-11-28_16_U2OS_40x_LS_GFP_mCherry_1_max_Merge_ROI_Cell1', '2019-11-28_16_U2OS_40x_LS_GFP_mCherry_1_max_Merge_ROI_Cell2'] # list name of prelocated TS files, located in the folder of the maxprojection. You can also load trk_result files.
TSregRadius: 10 # number of pixels in which to find TS

CalculateBackground: 0
